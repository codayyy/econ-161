# Foundations of Macroeconomics for Industrial Organization

Constant Elasticity Demand Function (Non-linear)

```math
q = p^{-\epsilon}
```

Where $q$ is sales for any given firm.

> [!NOTE]
> The industry level follows the firm level. If $MC$ is flat, rather than increasing, the industry supply will also be flat (constant).

## Inverse Market Demand

Inverse Market Demand Function:

```math
P = A-BQ
```

![inverse market demand curve](img/Lecture%200%20Foundations%20of%20IO_0.png)

Where:

- "$P$ is a function of $Q$"
- $B$ (not elasticity) is the slope
  - Recall: Linear demand (there are points on the graph where elasticity is 0, 1, and $+\infty$)
- $A$ (the maximum value (money) for one unit of consumption; aka WTP) is the Y-intercept
  - Moving along the demand curve decreases this max value
- $A/B$ (or $Q$) is the X-Intercept (independent variable)
  - Recall: We set A = 0

At $P_{1}$, this is the value of the marginal unit $Q_{1}$ (the $Q$th unit).

Each consumer will have different $WTP$. It's aggregation represents the market demand (or consumption).

## In Either Time Frame (Short- or Longrun), $\text{Demand} = \text{Supply}$

- In the LR, new capital, labor, and firms can enter the market
- At equilibrium, no consumer or firm would choose differently in how much to buy or sell

## Optimization

- Sell more when: P > MC(q)
- Total Revenue: $P - q$
- Total Cost: $P - C(q)$
- Profit $(\pi)$: $(P - AC) \times q$
- Optimal $Q$: $MR = MC$
  - $MC(q) = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta q}$
  - Keep selling as long as $MR > 0$ (and/or $P > MC(q)$)
    - Recall: $MR = \frac{\Delta TR}{\Delta q} = \frac{P\cancel{(q_{1} - q_{0})}}{\cancel{(q_{1} - q_{0})}} = P \therefore\ MR = MC = P$

> [!NOTE]
> $MC$ is non-decreasing (flat or raising), at least around its equilibrium point where $MR = MC$. There are points on the graph, however, when $MC$ is falling, but eventually raises again.

- The $MC$ of the next unit will never be less than the $MC$ of the previous unit
- If costs are falling, the firm will want to produce more $q$, and you are no longer in a perfect competition
  - But our initial assumption is that we are in a perfect competition

## Initial Assumption: Perfect Competition

- Recall: In perfect competition, $P$ is unaffected
- This is because each firm’s $q$ is small relative to the size of the market
- Therefore, there is no reason for anyone to consider anyone else when making production decisions

### More on Perfect Competition: Short-Run (SR)

Where $P_{c}$ and $q_{c}$ intersect, $MR = P = MC(q_{c})$.

This point Qc also lies in the Industry Supply \, S1\. Points Pc and Qc are on the line S1\.

![the long-run competitive equilibrium](img/Lecture%200%20Foundations%20of%20IO_1.png)

#### For The Firm

```math
P = MR = mc(q)
```

<!-- - This tells us that $q$ is a function of $P$. -->

> [!NOTE]
>
> - There is a positive relationship between $Q$ and $P$
> - Equilibrium with $AC$ and $MC$ is where $AC$ is at its minimum and $MC(q)$ is raising
> - Industry supply is upward sloping; when $P$ is increasing, $q_{c}$ has to increase

As P increases, we can sell more, but our MC also increases.

#### Market Equilibrium

```math
Q^{d}(P) = Q^{s}(P) = N \times q(P)
```

- $Q^{a} = A - BP$ or $P = A - BQ$

> [!NOTE] Recall:
> $N$ is fixed in the SR so $q(P)$ is what moves supply.

#### Changes in Demand

```math
Q_{1} = Nq1 > Qc = N \times q_{0}
```

- If demand rises, there would be an increase in $P$ as the demand curve would intersect at a higher point in industry supply $S_{1}\ (Q_{1}, P_{1}$).
- The higher $P$ would also mean that each firm would have to sell more, and $P_{1} = MC(q_{1})$ occurs at a higher output level, $q_{1}$.

### More on Perfect Competition: Long-Run (LR)

![the long-run competitive equilibrium](img/Lecture%200%20Foundations%20of%20IO_1.png)

Only when there are no excess profits per firm $(\pi = 0)$:

```math
P = AC(q), \text{ at the point } q^{c}\\
```

Additionally,

```math
P = mc\\
Q^{d}(P) = Q^{s}(P)
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - When $P_{1} > AC(q_1),\ P_{q} > TC,\ \pi > 0$
>
> - When $N$ increases, the supply curve shifts &rarr;
>   - At this point, $P_{c}$ is still the same as $P$ at ${Q_{C}}_{0}$ but Q_{C} itself is higher.
>   - From $P_1,\ P_{c}$ is lower
>
> - When $MC > AC \text{ (and) } q \text{ is high enough, } \pi > 0$.
>   - Extended periods of excess profits encourage the entry of new sellers, shifting the industry supply $S_{1}$ to the right just enough to lower $P$ from $P_{c} \longrightarrow P_{1}$ but where Q is higher at $Q'_{c}$ and lowers the market price. Now, $P = AC \therefore\ \pi = 0$.

To find the value of $N'$, we just find the ratio of the old and new quantities supplied/produced. Both of which should be greater than one $(1)$ because the new quantity (and number of firms N) has increased.

```math
\frac{Q_{c}'}{Q_{c}} > 1 \Longleftrightarrow \frac{N'}{N} > 1
```

### Welfare

![competition maximizes the total surplus](img/Lecture%200%20Foundations%20of%20IO_4.png)

Only at points $Q_{c}$ and $P_{c}$, the consumer surplus and producer surplus is maximized.

> [!NOTE] Recall the following
>
> - The demand function illustrates the $WTP$; while
> - (?) The supply function illustrates the $MC$
> - $P = MR$

At any point below $Q_{c},\ P'$ is higher than $P$.

> [!NOTE]
> Pay attention to the demand curve to find $P'$.

- At this lower $Q_{c}'$, surplus is not maximized. More specifically,
  - Consumer surplus is lower,
  - Producer surplus is higher,
  - Dead weight loss (DWL; aka loss is welfare) is created
    - Represents trades that could have happened but did not because $WTP > MC$

At any point above $Q_{c},\ P'$ is lower than $P$.

- The private sector will not want to supply at $Q_{g}$ so quantities from $Q_{c} \longrightarrow Q_{g}$ will have to be subsidized
  - Where $Q_{c}$ is the intersection between $P'$ and the supply curve
- For firms to supply at $Q_{g}$, $P$ has to increase
  - At this price level, only a few people have a $WTP$ greater than $P$ (only a few can afford to buy at that $P$ level)
- When there is a price discrepancy, DWL is also created (though on the other side)
  - Specifically, to provide $Q_{c} \longrightarrow Q_{g}$, someone myst pay for it therefore, there is a loss to society (i don't understand this point)
<!-- TODO: try to understand more -->

#### Recall: $\text{Utility} = WTP - P$

- People buy if utility > 0
- If $P > WTP$: people do not buy

## Monopoly

![marginal revenue from increased production for a monopolist](img/Lecture%200%20Foundations%20of%20IO_5.png)

The other side is monopoly, when the seller is large enough, so large that selling to the entire market demand is possible.

The monopolist can lower the price because its sells enough to satisfy market demand.

It then faces a trade off for selling more: sell one more unit but then the draw back is the price for everything you are selling falls by $\Delta P$.

This is the most important part of this part of the course. Because the monopoly can “feel” along the demand curve, it knows (or could know) the elasticity of demand.

```math
\eta_D=\frac{P}{Q} \frac{\partial Q}{\partial P}=\frac{\% \Delta Q}{\% \Delta P}
```

The elasticity of demand is a measure of this trade off.

## Monopoly Profit Max

So now a monopolist would have to factor in this price effect when it decides to sell one more unit as a cost to selling one more unit, in addition to marginal cost:

$MR = MC$ remains as the optimality condition but $MR$ is not just $P$.

```math
MR(q) = P + \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}q
```

> [!NOTE]
> The derivative of the demand function is negative so $MR < P$ for a monopolist.

## Monopoly Illustration

![textbook monopoly case](img/Lecture%200%20Foundations%20of%20IO_6.png)

In addition to MR=MC, we can also measure the industry/monopolist profit.

Its positive because Pm>AC(Qm). In this case, even with positive profits, there is no entry, so this figure also shows the long-run equilibrium.

## Marginal Revenue ($MR$)

In the simplified world we are working in, with P=A-BQ, the marginal revenue is:

```math
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial TR}{\partial Q} &= MR\\
                               &= A - BQ\\
                               &= A - 2BQ
\end{align}
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> ```math
> \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} = -B
> ```

With linear demand, monopolist marginal revenue is twice steep as the demand line.

## Market Power

Lerner index ($LI$) – one way to measure how well a market performs from an efficiency point of view.

- measures how far the outcome is from the competitive ideal:

```math
LI = \frac{P - MC}{P}
```

- Directly reflects the discrepancy between price and marginal cost, thus captures what is of interest when it comes to the exercise of market power.

$LI = 0$ for a competitive market, since competitive firms price at marginal cost.

For the pure monopolist\, the LI can be shown to be the inverse of the elasticity of demand – the less elastic the demand, the greater the price-marginal cost distortion

```math
MR = P + \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q}Q
```

For profit max, set $MR = MC \rightarrow MC = P + \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q}Q$

Rearranging and dividing by price $P$: $\frac{P - MC}{P} = -\frac{\Delta P}{\Delta Q} \frac{Q}{P} = \frac{1}{\eta}$

Where $\frac{1}{\eta}$ is the inverse of the elasticity of demand

Lerner index cannot exceed $1$ and only reaches it if $MC=0$

Market-Wide Lerner Index

With more than one but not a large number of firms, measuring the $LI$ requires an average of marginal costs.

When the commodity is homogenous so that all firms must sell at exactly the same price, then:

```math
LI = \frac{P - \sum^{N}_{i} s_{i}MC_{i}}{P}
```

The greater the $LI$, the farther the market outcome lies from the competitive case and the more market power is being exploited.

- Drawbacks
  - Problem of market definition
  - LI is difficult to measure\, requires estimating elasticity of demand and marginal cost
  - Interpretation remains ambiguous\, e.g.,
    - Firms with high sunk cost to enter an industry
    - Setting where cost-reducing innovations are important.

![concentration ratios, price-cost margins, and number of establishments in the manufacturing sector](img/Lecture%200%20Foundations%20of%20IO_11.jpg)

## Welfare Loss of Monopoly

We can see that the market figure for monopoly can show the welfare loss from monopoly. Notice that $Q_{m} < Q_{c}$, which is the reason for the welfare loss.

The deadweight loss triangle can be divided into the consumer welfare loss and the producer surplus loss. But note that producer surplus is greater under monopoly, so the interpretation of producer surplus is not the same thing as industry profit. (interpret the producer surplus loss)

![deadweight loss of monopoly](img/Lecture%200%20Foundations%20of%20IO_12.png)

## Costs of Monopolies

Measure of monopoly losses – the welfare triangle, the deadweight loss or triangle that results from prices above marginal cost:

```math
WL = \frac{1}{2}(P - MC)(Q^{C} - Q)
```

Expressing this as a proportion of total sales

```math
\begin{align}
WL' &= \frac{WL}{PQ}\\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \frac{P - MC}{P} \frac{Q^{C} - Q}{Q}
\end{align}
```

With

```math
\eta = \frac{(Q^{C} - Q)/Q}{(P - MC)/P} \Longrightarrow \frac{Q^{C} - Q}{Q} = \eta \frac{P - MC}{P}
```

Then, we have

```math
\begin{align}
WL' &= \frac{WL}{PQ}\\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \eta (LI)^{2}
\end{align}
```

Recall that in a pure monopolist

```math
LI = \frac{P - MC}{P} = \frac{1}{\eta}
```

Therefore:

```math
\begin{align}
WL' &= \frac{WL}{PQ}\\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{\eta}
\end{align}
```

For the perfect monopoly case, the deadweight loss as a fraction of current industry sales is simply one-half the LI or one over twice the elasticity of demand.

## Time and Industry Structure

- Considerations of time introduce potential constraints on the exercise of monopoly power, and on the consequent welfare loss.
- One mechanism = dynamics of industry structure
  - Long run effect depends on whether the economic profit or surplus would attract entry and
- competition over time
- Sensible requirement for a long-run equilibrium – no incentive for the industry structure to change.
  - &rarr; all firms earn zero profit &rarr; Price = Average Cost
- Imposing the condition that $P = AC$ provides a way to determine the equilibrium structure of the industry
  - Idea of contestable markets = to the extent that the market permits entry by rivals over time, the ability of monopolist to sustain a price above marginal cost will be lessened

However, firms with monopoly power may be able to take actions that protect power against rival entrants over time

Market structure at any point in time may not be an accurate gauge of the intensity of competition in an industry.

Every monopolist can be constrained by potential entry, but entry deterrence typically require that a cost be incurred today in return for higher profits in the future, inevitably involving comparison of profits at different points of time

## Discounting Future streams of Revenue, Cost, and Profit

- To evaluate trade-offs of current vs. future incomes use notion of present values - how much we have to pay today in order to get a particular payment one year from the present.
  - Interest rate is the opportunity cost of your money

### Discounting

The present value of a piece of paper (loan contract or share of stock) promising an owner a payment of $Z$ is $\frac{Z}{1 + r}$.

- Discount Factor: $\frac{1}{1 + r} = R$
- PV of $Z$ pesos = $RZ$

Generally,

- An amount $Y$ will yield $Y(1 + r)^{t}$ for $t$ years or $YR^{t}$
- PV of an amount $Z$ to be received $t$ periods from now is just $R^{t}Z$
- The present value of a stream (with unequal amounts) will be the sum of all individual present values

```math
\begin{align}
PV &= RZ_{1} + R^{2}Z_{2} + R^{3}Z_{3} + \dots + R^{T}Z_{T}\\
   &= \sum^{T}_{t=1} R^{t}Z_{t}
\end{align}
```

If the income received in each period is the same, then

```math
PV = \frac{Z}{1 - R}(R - R^{T + 1})
```

Case when income receipt constant at $\overline{Z}$ and stream persists in the indefinite future so that the terminal period T approaches infinity.

- Since the discount factor is less than one, the term $R^{T+1} \longrightarrow 0$. Hence,

```math
\begin{align}
PV &= \frac{\overline{Z}}{1 - R}R\\
   &= \frac{\overline{Z}}{r}
\end{align}
```

A rise in the interest rate implies a decrease in the present value of any given future income stream.

## Intertemporal Trades

- Profit maximization &rarr; firms maximize the present value of all current and future profit.
  - Evaluating the desirability of profit trade-off over time is to discount, or translate the future peso inflows into a current or present value that may then be compared with the current expense necessary to secure those future receipts.
  - If the present value of the future income is not at least as great as the value of the necessary expense, then the trade-off is not favorable.

## Durable Goods

- Time considerations constrain monopoly power in connection with durable goods
- Durable goods
  - Last a number of years (e.g., cars, appliances)
  - Monopolist has to think about initial price to set and the volume to be sold currently.
  - Supply will be around to influence market outcomes one or two periods later.
- Ronald Coase (1972) &rarr; durability might greatly reduce if not eliminate the ability of the monopolist to set prices above the efficient level even in the current period

> [!NOTE] Example
>
> - Two discrete periods
> - Two units of a durable good (provide services with no loss due to depreciation)
> - Two potential consumers
>   - High value - values the services of the good at $50$
>   - Low value - values the services of the good at $30$
> - Present value of the services from the good
>   - High value consumer $= 50 + R50 = (1 + R)50$
>   - Low value consumer $=  30 + R30 = (1 + R)30$
> - Marginal production cost $= 0$
> - Maximum total surplus from the market is: $(1 + R)80$
> - Outcome that yields this surplus is efficient, outcome that yields less is inefficient.

- Monopolist maximizes his own surplus (not total) and recognize the following constraints
  - If first period price is below (1 + R)30 &rarr; both units will be sold at the first period and both consumers enjoy the services from the good
  - If price is above $(1 + R)30$ but less than $(1 + R)50$ one unit will be sold in the first period
    - Monopolist will enter the second period with one unit left which can be sold to the low value consumer for $30$
  - If price is above $(1 + R)30$ and greater than $(1 + R)50$ no units will be sold
    - The monopolist will face the choice between selling either both units at a price of Php$30$ or one unit at a price of Php$50$. Best option is to sell the two units at Php$30$ for a profit of Php$60$
  - Important implication – any and all second period sales must take place at the price of Php$30$
  
> [!NOTE]
> If $P < (1+R)50$, one unit will be sold to the high and his surplus will be $(50 - P)(1 + R)$

- From point of view of consumer - consider the firm strategy of making one first period sale to the high value consumer at $(1 + R)50$
  - If high value consumer purchases in the first period, his surplus is zero
  - If high value consumer waits for the second period, he gets a net surplus of $R20$ in present value terms (since his value is 50 and he has to pay 30).
  - High value consumer will choose the latter because he can have a positive surplus.
  - Monopolist will not be able to sell in the first period at $(1 + R)50$

- What about a price below $(1 + R)50$ but above $(1 + R)30$.
  - First period price $(1 + R)(30 + \epsilon)$ where $\epsilon$ is a small positive constant.
  - High value consumer’s surplus is $(1 + R)(20 − \epsilon)$
  - If consumer waits and purchases the good next period at 30, there will be a surplus with a present value of $R20$.
  - For the monopolist to sell to this consumer in the first period, the monopolist offers a price such that:

```math
(1 + R)(20 − \epsilon) > R20 \longrightarrow \epsilon ≤ \frac{20}{1 + R}
```

- Monopolist chooses highest 𝜀 possible. Therefore, the maximum price that the monopolist can set in the first period in order to sell just one unit is

```math
(1 + R)\left(30 + \frac{20}{1 + R}\right) = (1 + R)30 + 20
```

| First period price | Second period price | Present value of profits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $(1 + R)30$ | None | ? |
| $(1 + R)30 + 20$ | ? | ? |
| > $(1 + R)50$ | ? | ? |

> [!NOTE]
> Durable goods allows us to reach the max total surplus (CS+PS) possible, so is efficient, but 60/80% will go to the monopolist

Coase conjecture: the durable feature of the good has constrained the monopolist to set efficient prices – one that maximizes surplus. Durability constrains monopoly pricing so as to eliminate any deadweight loss

- However, impact of durability can be weakened. Example:
  - Suppose low-value consumer only valued the services at $20$ per period or $(1 + R)20$ in total
  - If the monopolist sells no units in the first period and enters the second period with $2$ units to sell, it will be preferable to sell one unit to the high value consumer at $50$ rather than both at $20$ each.
  - The consumer will now prefer any price of $(1 + R)(50 − \epsilon)$ in the first period that provides a surplus of $(1 + 𝑅)(\epsilon)$ to a price of $50$ in the second period with no surplus.
  - By making $\epsilon$ arbitrarily small, the monopolist can induce the high value consumers to buy in the first period and then sell at a price of say $20$ to the low value consumer in the second period
- Durability has not eliminated the deadweight loss

> [!NOTE]
> Max Total surplus is (1+R)80, but monopolist makes (1+R)(50-e) +R20,  the =DWL is 20 (e is small)

- Generalization regarding the Coase conjecture
  - The more that consumer valuations are continuous, the more that durability constrains the monopoly pricing of durable goods to be efficient.
  - As the distribution becomes perfectly continuous, the monopolist may be forced to set competitive prices.

## Homework

### 1. Practice Problem 2.1 (p. 24)

Assume that the manufacturing of cellular phones is a perfectly competitive industry. The market demand for cellular phones is described by a linear demand function: $Q^{D} = \frac{6000 - 50Р}{9}$. There are fifty manufacturers of cellular phones. Each manufacturer has the same production costs. These are described by long-run total and marginal cost functions of $TC(q) = 100 + q^{2} + 10q$, and $MC(q) = 2q + 10$.

1. Show that a firm in this industry maximizes profit by producing $q = \frac{9 - 10}{2}$.

$\text{Recall: } P = MC(q)$

```math
\begin{align}
P &= 2q + 10\\
2q &= P - 10\\
q &= \frac{P - 10}{2}\ \blacksquare
\end{align}
```

2. Derive the industry supply curve and show that it is $Q^{S} = 25P - 250$.

```math
\begin{align}
Q^{S} &= N \times q(P)\\
      &= 50 \times \frac{P - 10}{2}\\
      &= 25 \times (P - 10)\\
      &= 25P - 250\ \blacksquare
\end{align}
```

3. Find the market price and aggregate quantity traded in equilibrium.

$\text{At equilibrium, } Q^{S} = Q^{D}$.

```math
\begin{align}
25P - 250 &= \frac{6000 - 50Р}{9}\\
225P - 2250 &= 6000 - 50P\\
225P + 50P &= 6000 + 2250\\
275P &= 8250\\
P^{*} &= 30\ \blacksquare
\end{align}
```

```math
\begin{align}
Q^{*} &= 25P - 250\\
      &= 25(30) - 250\\
      &= 500\ \blacksquare
\end{align}
```

4. How much output does each firm produce? Show that each firm earns zero profit in equilibrium.

$\text{Again, } Q^{S} = N \times q(P)$.

```math
\begin{align}
500 &= 50 \times q(P)\\
q(P) &= 10
\end{align}
```

$\text{Recall: } \pi = (P \times q) - TC(q)$.

```math
\begin{align}
\pi &= (30 \times 10) - 100 + 10^{2} + (10 \times 10)\\
    &= \cancel{300} - \cancel{100 - 100 - 100}\\
    &= 0\ \blacksquare
\end{align}
```
